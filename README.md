# Weather-Forecast-Dashboard

## Description

This is an app for displaying current as well as a 5-Day weather forecast.
It uses a Third-party API, openweathermap.org, to fetch the most current weather for the desired city that you search.
When a user searches for a city name, the app will then display data for temperature, humidity as well as wind speed in metric system.

It also saves upto 10 previously searched cities, until refreshed, thereupon clearing the history list.
Upon refreshing the page, the app will display the weather information for the last searched city.
when incorrect name is entered or when no text is entered in the search form, an error modal will pop up, notifying the user to enter correct city name. This modal can be closed by pressing x.
